# NestJS Project Overview

This project is built using **NestJS**, a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, scalable server-side applications.

## ✅ Features and Concepts I Have Implemented / Explored

### 🔐 CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
- CORS is configured to allow or restrict access from specific origins.
- Ability to **limit by IP address or origin** for enhanced security.

### 🌐 RESTful API
- Built using **RESTful architecture** principles.
- Supports common HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.

### ⚠️ Global Error Handling
- Global error and log handling setup using built-in NestJS features.
- Ensures clean, centralized management of all exceptions.

### 📈 Rate Limiting
- Implemented **rate limiting** at the global level to prevent abuse.
- Helps in throttling requests for public-facing APIs.

### ❗ Exception Filters
- Used NestJS **exception filters** for custom error handling.
- Filters make error responses more descriptive and client-friendly.

### 🧾 DTO (Data Transfer Objects)
- Utilized **DTOs** to define data shape and apply validation using `class-validator`.
- Keeps data flow clean and ensures validation at the controller level.

### 🔀 API Versioning
- Setup **version control** for APIs (`v1`, `v2`, etc.) to support backward compatibility.

## 🧠 Concepts I'm Aware Of
- **What is a DTO**: A structured object for transmitting data between layers.
- **Global-level configurations**: Logging, filters, guards, pipes, and interceptors.
- While not everything is known in depth yet, documentation and community support are great, and concepts can be explored further as needed.

## 📌 TODO / Next Steps
- Explore Guards and Middleware in NestJS.
- Add Swagger for API documentation.
- Implement authentication (e.g., JWT strategy using Passport).
- Add unit and e2e testing using Jest.
